# NASAAPODProject

this is the open source version of the NASA APOD API project that I already have in my personal repo.

# locally running this

just use any live server extension, like, "Live Preview", and run it. this is a vanilla JS implementation, no bundling involved.

# add your own NASA API key

at this line, in script.js

```
    const apikey = "INSERTYOURNASAPIKEYHERE";
```

# currently deployed at (as of June 23 2023)

# known issues

1. for some reason, the most recent developer, did not make the image display responsive. so, it will look stretched out when window size is narrow or when looking at from a mobile phone.
